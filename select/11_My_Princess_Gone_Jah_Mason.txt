Rastafari know
Wey mi princess dey star
Come in like she mek a trod a ya
Jah know
Yo, den, yo, yo, yo, den, yo

My Princess gawn
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay
My Princess gawn
Far far awa-aay
And she left me a noo-oote
Saying she's going to stay

From di odda day, sey she a flop up, & mi see sey she go flip
Wit di likkle short shorts, she have hitch up pan har hip
Is like she all forget about, di royalness
Har fren an company, she a follow mi get di tip
Yo, roundabout she just a jump, she jus a skip
Say whappen to the? You know you use to keep
Say whappen to the King, wey you use to be wit
Yo, well mi see sey dat a un. unloyal

She jus gawn
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay
My Princess gawn
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay

I mek di trod inna di days, she mek di trod inna di night
And she know say she was wrong
And she know dat I was right
Whappen to royalness, no more yu nah act polite
When mi see sey dat you, ready fi, put up a fight
From di odda day mi, see sey yu, acting hype
When yuh friend dem you go follow, an yu follow di wrong type

My Princess gone
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay
My Princess gone
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay

From di odda day she just a flop up, & mi see say she go flip
Wit di likkle short shorts, she have hitch up pan har hip
She nuh memba bout di, king royalness
When a fren an company, she a follow mi a get di tip
Say whappen to the King man you use to be wit
Yo, well a, it seem like sey she diss

My Princess gone
Far far away
And she left me a note
Saying she's going to stay

My Princess gone
Far far away
Yo
