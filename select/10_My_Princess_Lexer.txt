Ooh
Don't treat me like a fool
Nooo nooo
You dont love me
Even if you say you do
You don't deserve me
Don't treat me like a fool
(Don't treat me like a fool)

You dont love me
Even if you say you do
You don't deserve me
Don't treat me like a fool

Dont treat me like fool
Dont treat me like fool
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Our moments that we spend toghether
Are worthless
All the promises that we gave each other
Mean nothing to you
You are the devil, you broke me into pieces
You are mother that you care and no one believes it
Now now

You dont love me
Even if you say you do
You don't deserve me
Dont treat me like fool
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Dont treat me like fool
You don't love me
Even if you say you do

You don't deserve me
Don't treat me like fool
(Don't treat me like fool)

You don't love me
Even if you say you do (do do)
You don't deserve me
Dont treat me like fool
Don't treat me like fool
Don't treat me like fool
Ooh
Don't treat me like fool
Ooh
Don't treat me like fool
Ooh
Don't treat me like fool
