Breath every day of your life
You don't know why
I know you're just the evil-eye
But you look like
A fucking paradize

Be my princess
Be mine tonight

Beed everday of your life
You don't know why
I know you're just the evil-eye
But you look like
A fucking paradize

Somedays you just wan to pass away
Somedays you feel like it's a perfect day
Somedays you cry
Somedays you smile
Somedays are better than others

Somedays you just wan to pass away
Somedays you feel like it's a beautiful day
Somedays you cry
Somedays you smile
Somedays are better than others

Now I dream I can fly...

Far above the ground
Without you
Now I touch the sky
