My princess is in another castle baby
Oh no, I don't mind the hassle ladies
So I leap into the streets
And try to grab mushrooms to eat, yeah
My princess is in another castle...

Cause I was born to jump, born to rock
Born to jump, born to rock, rock, rock

My princess is on the floor
Yeah she wants to hear some rock 'n' roll (x4)

Dungeon's where the monster hides
Fireball in his eyes
Fireball is a hot jawbreaker
I'll break your jaw
And then I'll see you later

My princess is in another castle baby
Oh no, I don't mind the hassle ladies
So I leap into the streets
And try and grab mushrooms to eat, yeah
My princess is in another castle...

Cause I was born to jump, born to rock
Born to jump, born to rock, rock, rock

My princess is on the floor
Yeah she wants to hear some rock 'n' roll (x4)

You know she hates being left alone
So I warp right to her zone
Warp zone, you can go much faster
But don't be late, it'll be a disaster
Born to jump, born to rock
Born to jump, born to rock
Said I was born to jump, born to rock
Born to jump, born to rock, rock, rock

My princess is in another castle baby
Oh no, I don't mind the hassle ladies
So I leap into the streets
And try to grab mushrooms to eat, yeah
My princess is in another castle...
